  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Start Backend Server
```powershell
cd BACKEND
npm install  # if not done already
npm run dev
```

Server should start on port `9785` (or your configured port).

### Step 2: Start Frontend
```powershell
# In project root
npm install  # if not done already
npx expo start --port 30019
```

### Step 3: Test Image Upload

#### Option A: Using Expo Go (Mobile Device)
1. Scan QR code with Expo Go app
2. Navigate to "Final Inventory" tab
3. Tap **"üìÅ Pick Image"** to select from gallery
4. OR tap **"üì∑ Take Photo"** to use camera
5. Wait for upload (shows "Uploading..." indicator)
6. Image preview appears when upload completes
7. Fill in product details (Name, Qty, Price)
8. Tap **"Add Product"**
9. Product should appear in list with image thumbnail

#### Option B: Test API Directly (cURL)
```powershell
# Test upload endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:9785/api/upload `
  -F "image=@path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "data": {
    "filename": "image-1697123456789-123456789.jpg",
    "url": "http://localhost:9785/uploads/image-1697123456789-123456789.jpg",
    "path": "/uploads/image-1697123456789-123456789.jpg"
  }
}
```

#### Option C: Test in Web Browser (if expo web supported)
```powershell
npx expo start --web
```

**Note**: Camera may not work in web browser, but gallery picker should work.

## üìù Usage in Code

### Frontend (React Native)
```typescript
import { apiService } from '@/services/apiService';
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

// Pick and upload image
const pickAndUpload = async () => {
  const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
    mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
    allowsEditing: true,
    quality: 0.8,
  });

  if (!result.canceled && result.assets[0]) {
    const response = await apiService.upload.uploadImage(result.assets[0].uri);
    if (response.success) {
      const imageUrl = response.data.url;
      // Use imageUrl in your product data
    }
  }
};
```

### Backend (Express.js)
```javascript
// Upload route is already configured
// Access uploaded file data via req.file
router.post('/upload', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  const fileUrl = `/uploads/${req.file.filename}`;
  res.json({ success: true, data: { url: fileUrl } });
});
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot find module 'expo-image-picker'"
**Solution**:
```powershell
npm install
# OR
npx expo install expo-image-picker
```

### Problem: "Permission Denied" when accessing camera/gallery
**Solution**: 
- On iOS: Check Settings > [Your App] > Enable Photos/Camera
- On Android: Grant permissions when prompted
- In code: `ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync()` is already called

### Problem: Upload fails with network error
**Solution**:
1. Check backend server is running
2. Verify API_BASE_URL in `config/environment.ts`
3. For physical device: Use your computer's IP instead of localhost
   ```typescript
   // In config/environment.ts
   baseUrls: {
     development: 'http://192.168.x.x:9785',  // Your computer's IP
   }
   ```

### Problem: Images don't display after upload
**Solution**:
1. Verify `app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'))` in server.js
2. Check BACKEND/uploads/ folder contains files
3. Test direct URL: `http://localhost:9785/uploads/[filename]`

### Problem: "File too large" error
**Solution**:
- Current limit: 5MB
- To increase, edit `BACKEND/routes/upload.js`:
  ```javascript
  const upload = multer({
    limits: { fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 } // 10MB
  });
  ```

---

## üåê Production Deployment

### Update URLs for Production
In `config/environment.ts`:
```typescript
baseUrls: {
  production: 'http://nindam.sytes.net:9785'
}
```

### Ensure Uploads Directory Permissions
```bash
# On production server
mkdir -p BACKEND/uploads
chmod 755 BACKEND/uploads
```

### Static File Serving
Backend automatically serves files from `/uploads/` route.
Uploaded images accessible at:
```
http://nindam.sytes.net:9785/uploads/[filename].jpg
```
